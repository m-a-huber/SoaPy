# SoaPy

Soapy is a Python package intended to facilitate the life of anyone working with Seifert fibered spaces (SFS).
The main file is "soapy.py", which allows the user to work with the classes soapy.SFS as well as its subclasses soapy.Lens, soapy.Prism and soapy.Brieskorn.
For a given SFS $Y$, the package allows one to find, among other things,

- a definite plumbing description of $Y$;
- the corresponding linking matrix;
- the $\text{HF}^{+}(Y)$; and
- the Casson-Walker invariant $\lambda(Y)$.

Moreover, the package allows one to check if a given pair $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ of SFS passes a certain obstruction to there existing an ribbon rational homology cobordism from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$.
Lastly, the package comes with built-in functions to check if two different Seifert fiberings represent the same $3$-manifold.
