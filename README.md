# SoaPy

SoaPy is a Python package intended to facilitate the life of anyone working with Seifert fibered rational homology spheres (SFS).
The package allows the user to work with the class soapy.SFS as well as its subclasses soapy.Lens, soapy.Prism and soapy.Brieskorn.
For a given SFS Y, the package allows one to find, among other things,

- a definite plumbing description of Y;
- the corresponding linking matrix;
- the first homology of Y;
- HF^+(Y); and
- the Casson-Walker invariant of Y.

Moreover, the package allows one to check if a given pair Y\_1 and Y\_2 of SFS passes a certain obstruction to there existing an ribbon rational homology cobordism from Y\_1 to Y\_2.

Lastly, the package comes with built-in functions to check if a given SFS is homeomorphic to a lens space or a prism manifold, and if two different parametrizations of a SFS actually  represent the same SFS.
